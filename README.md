Rethink.swift
-------------

A client driver for RethinkDB in Swift.

Looking for a Mac app to easily query RethinkDB? Convert and analyze large data sets at the speed of light with [Warp](http://warp.one). 

### Usage

```swift
R.connect(URL(string: "rethinkdb://localhost:28016")!, user: "admin", password: "") { err, connection in
	assert(err == nil, "Connection error: \(err)")

	// Connected!
	R.dbCreate(databaseName).run(connection) { response in
		assert(!response.isError, "Failed to create database: \(response)")

		R.db(databaseName).tableCreate(tableName).run(connection) { response in
			assert(!response.isError, "Failed to create table: \(response)")

			R.db(databaseName).table(tableName).indexWait().run(connection) { response in
				assert(!response.isError, "Failed to wait for index: \(response)")

				// Insert 1000 documents
				var docs: [ReDocument] = []
				for i in 0..<1000 {
					docs.append(["foo": "bar", "id": i])
				}

				R.db(databaseName).table(tableName).insert(docs).run(connection) { response in
					assert(!response.isError, "Failed to insert data: \(response)")

					R.db(databaseName).table(tableName).filter({ r in return r["foo"].eq(R.expr("bar")) }).run(connection) { response in 
						...
					}

					R.db(databaseName).table(tableName).count().run(connection) { response in
						...
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

### Status

The driver implements the V1_0 protocol (which supports username/password authentication using SCRAM, and is available 
from RethinkDB 2.3.0). Alternatively, you can also use V0_4. Some commands and optional arguments may still be missing,
but are usually easy to add to the code.

The driver is written for Swift 3. The last version working in Swift 2.2 can be found at the tag 'last-swift2'.

### Installation

#### Swift Package Manager (SPM)

You can install the driver using Swift Package Manager by adding the following line to your ```Package.swift``` as a dependency:

```
.Package(url: "https://github.com/pixelspark/rethink-swift.git", majorVersion: 1)
```

To use the driver in an Xcode project, generate an Xcode project file using SPM:
```
swift package generate-xcodeproj
```
Open the Xcode project file and open the .xcconfig file located under the Config folder and add the following Objective-C build settings:
```
CLANG_ENABLE_MODULES = YES
CLANG_ENABLE_OBJC_ARC = YES
HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS = $(inherited) "$(SRCROOT)/Packages/**"
```

#### Manual
To use the driver in an Xcode project, generate an Xcode project file using SPM:
```
swift package generate-xcodeproj
```

Drag the generated Rethink.xcodeproj into your own project, then add Rethink or Rethink iOS as dependency (build targets) and link to it.
You should then be able to simply 'import Rethink' from Swift code.
